Therefore, I believe that my physique is likely better than I feel that it is. ","I feel immense pressure to have an aesthetically pleasing, well-developed body because of all media influences (e.g., films, television series, comic books, books, real life experiences and social media) as opposed to just social media influences. I feel I should always be lean enough to have visible abs and a well-defined midsection, as well as arm and shoulder vascularity at all times regardless of factors such as lighting conditions and water retention. I feel I am also too small, and have a poor shoulder-to-hip width ratio.  ","The presentation in all forms of media of the ideal man as extremely tall, with a well-sculpted jawline and perfect hair, and with an unhealthily lean and absurdly muscular body likely contributes to body dysmorphia above all else. The further away you move from this paragon, the less masculine and respectable as a man you are perceived as. ","Let go of striving for aesthetic perfection, as that is likely impossible for most people even with considerable chemical enhancement and extreme discipline and dedication. You will always have visual flaws, whether it be a pimple or mole you can't seem to get rid of, or an overbite no orthodontist can properly align. Focus more on developing athletic ability, because strength, mobility, agility, aerobic capacity and muscular endurance all have more translation to day-to-day life than hypertrophy-focused training regimens. Even then, remember that your appearance and physical ability do not define you nearly as much as the actions you take and their consequences for the world around you. "

First of all, they call me the ""ammosexual luddite Shpka"", because apparently I'm a perfect doppelganger of actress Kiernan Shipka (due to my babyface and 18.5 skinny BMI), I am 100% asexual and aromantic (so care zero about my aesthetics), I refuse to own a smartphone or use any social media (this Linux desktop is only used 20 minutes a day for the ar15.com forum and protonmail) and, most importantly, I spend 99% of my day, namely 15 hours, outdoors away from any screens and electronics. Where? At the shooting range, where I work as rifle instructor, volunteer for GOA (Guns Owners of America), exercise/compete as Glock sponsored 2gun athlete, and hang out socially/shoot recreationally with fellow 2nd amendment rights supporters. And I spend 90% of my six figures income on firearms. I also only dress 5.11Tactical woman apparel, because I care about comfort, not aesthetics.
So it is clear I'm not the target demographic for this survey. My physical form is only an indirect consequence of me running around literally all day everyday with a rifle (according to my family physician, I burn more calories in a day than a pro Tennis player in a week), in fact I don't even diet, I eat Texan BBQ almost every single day.
But again most of the questions above are utterly unapplicable for two reasons, already explained, so just reiterating 1)I do not use any social media, and 2)being asexual I care zero about my appearance. The only interest in my body is performance, being quick in unholstering my sidearm or geting back up quickly after dropping prone with my rifle, that is ALL I care about."

Most people forget to take a stroll through Walmart on the weekend and get a healthy dose of reality. 95% of people look nowhere as good as people that even casually lift, much less those that obsess over it. ","Get out in the world more. Spend less time in your bubbles and pay more attention to truly regular people. You’ll be surprised by how impressed you’ll be. And remember to compare to your starting point as well. And the last thing: your image may take a lot of work and may be very important to you, but the truth is, no one else actually cares as much as you do, because it’s not their body. That’s okay, and that’s normal. You may get enjoyment and satisfaction from getting healthier and hotter, but true happiness probably doesn’t come from that alone. Work on other parts of yourself, work on your hobbies, tend to your passions, and build the person you want to be — in all aspects. Your image is only one of them."

Little to none. Because many people (women) allow themselves to be greatly influenced by social media? Significantly more.,Non-critical thinking that the perfect picture captured at the perfect moment in the perfect lighting is a realistic depiction of someone's real life.,"Accept that you are as deluded the next person and like everyone else, you have a blind spot. Trust what people who love you, care for you and want what's best for you, tell you. Accept what those who love you most tell you. Trust them until they give you a reason not to. Hopefully that will never happen."
